### abstract
The original goal of this project was more than just a portfolio. I wanted to see what the process of creating a simple image hosting platform for my own photographic work was like, without having to depend on traditional image sharing platforms such as the small-formatted Instagram, the once-a-day doozy of BeReal, the aging Tumblr, the costly Flickr, or even the quick-to-deploy SquareSpace. As efficient, service-rich, and popular these platforms are, dombui.com originally intended to surpass the limitations of these platforms; limitations such as Instagram's maximum res of 1080 x 1350px, or SquareSpace's generic web templates. I wanted to 'liberate my work' from the limitations of these platforms, and to host and share my own work by my own means, according to my style and personality.

The Web is a medium — like canvas, paper, etc. — and dombui.com is my medium, and I enjoyed the experience of using web development as a tool to exhibit my work. With dombui.com, my work is no longer overshadowed by things like advertising and subscriptions, and is freely expressed.
